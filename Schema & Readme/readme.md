Welcome to Meta City developed by Zaw using superheroapi. 

1. Meta city is a place that you can find any super heros from any universe in one place. The main object of this site is to create a place that all super hero fans can find and share their thoughts on super heros they like.

2. You can read API documentation and try here: ``` https://www.superheroapi.com/ ```

3. If you have CORS issue to get datas from API, I recommad to use chrome without CORS blocking to help API run well. 
    - On macOS, execute ``` open -na "Google Chrome" --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_session" ``` in terminal. 
    - On WindowOS, execute ``` chrome.exe --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:/ChromeDevSession" ``` in command prompt. 
    - On LinuxOS, ``` google-chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_session" ``` in terminal.

4. Here is the link to try my site: ``` https://metacity.onrender.com ```. IF you find there is no data in all heroes, please try out step-3.
